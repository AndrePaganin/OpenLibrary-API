# OpenLibrary-API

Utilising the OpenLibrary API, it does a simple book search that shows the top 10 book results for a given search term.

Created a landing page where you can input the search term i.e. “Lord of the rings”.

On clicking an OK button, the app will show the top 10 books (title, cover, author, year etc.) for that
search.

Has some examples of error handling and input validation.

UI written with UIKit.
